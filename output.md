Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

So, you're looking to add some memory to your CrewAI setup? Awesome, let's dive into how you can make your crew remember things!

Here's a breakdown of how to add memory to your crew, along with a code example and some extra tips to make sure you nail it:

**How to Add Memory to Your Crew**

The basic idea is that you'll use CrewAI's built-in `MemoryStore` to keep track of important stuff during your crew's operation. This could be anything from task status to agent progress, or even specific pieces of information they need to remember.

Here's the step-by-step:

1.  **Set Up Your Crew:** First, you'll need to define your agents, tasks, and workflows just like you normally would when creating a crew. This is the foundation of your crew's work.

2.  **Create a Memory Store:**  You'll use `crewai.MemoryStore()` to create a memory store. This is where your crew's memories will be kept. Think of it like a digital notebook for your crew.

3.  **Add Memory to Your Crew:** You'll use `crew.add_memory_store(memory)` to add the memory store to your crew. This links the memory to your agents and tasks.

4.  **Define a Memory Schema:** This is optional, but highly recommended. It helps you structure the data you're saving in your memory store. It's like setting up the categories in your notebook. You can define what kind of information you'll store, like task status, progress, or any other relevant data.

5.  **Use the Memory Feature:** Now, you can use the `memory_store` to store and retrieve data. You can use `set` to store data, and `get` to retrieve it. You can also use `list` to see all the keys that are stored and `delete` to remove a key.

6.  **Interact with the Memory Store:** Use the CrewAI API to interact with the memory store. This allows you to manage and access the data that your crew has stored.

**Code Example**

Hereâ€™s a code example to get you started. Remember, this is just a starting point, and you'll need to adjust it to fit your crew's specific needs:

```python
import crewai

# 1. Create a new crew
crew = crewai.Crew()

# 2. Define the agents, tasks, and workflows
agents = [
    crewai.Agent(name="Researcher", role="researcher"),
    crewai.Agent(name="Writer", role="writer")
]

tasks = [
    crewai.Task(name="Research", agent=agents[0]),
    crewai.Task(name="Write", agent=agents[1])
]

workflows = [
    crewai.Workflow(name="Research and Write", tasks=[tasks[0], tasks[1]])
]

# 3. Add the memory feature to the crew
memory = crewai.MemoryStore()
crew.add_memory_store(memory)

# 4. Define the memory schema (optional but recommended)
memory_schema = {
    "tasks": {
        "Research": {
            "status": "string",
            "progress": "number"
        },
        "Write": {
            "status": "string",
            "progress": "number"
        }
    }
}

# 5. Use the memory feature to store and retrieve data
crew.memory_store.set("tasks", "Research", {"status": "in_progress", "progress": 0.5})
research_task_data = crew.memory_store.get("tasks", "Research")
print(f"Research Task Data: {research_task_data}")

# 6. Use the CrewAI API to interact with the memory store
all_tasks = crew.memory_store.list("tasks")
print(f"All Tasks in Memory: {all_tasks}")
crew.memory_store.delete("tasks", "Research")
print(f"All Tasks in Memory after delete: {crew.memory_store.list('tasks')}")
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

*   We start by importing the `crewai` library.
*   We create a crew and define our agents, tasks, and workflows.
*   We create a `MemoryStore` object.
*   We add the `MemoryStore` to our crew using `crew.add_memory_store(memory)`.
*   We define a `memory_schema` to structure our data (this is optional).
*   We use `crew.memory_store.set()` to store data, `crew.memory_store.get()` to retrieve data, `crew.memory_store.list()` to list all the keys and `crew.memory_store.delete()` to delete a key.
*   We print the results to the console.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Adapt to Your Needs:** This is a basic example. You'll need to customize the memory schema and how you store/retrieve data to match your specific workflow.
*   **Flexibility:** The `MemoryStore` is flexible, you can store anything you need to keep track of during your crew's operation.
*   **Persistence:** By default, the memory is not persistent. If you need to store data between sessions, you'll need to use a persistent storage solution like a database or a file-based system.
